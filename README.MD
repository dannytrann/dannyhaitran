## Installation

I've hosted it on my domain so you can reach it on here :

http://dannyhaitran.com/projects/twitterexpress

I've done so for the ease of checking.

Since i'm using CodeIgniter I set the project up with an Apache Hosting with virtual host on my system.

To host this project locally, set up local hosting with the home directory pointed to the root of the folder
